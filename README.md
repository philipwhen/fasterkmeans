# Faster kmeans
A new bound update function based on Hamerly's algorithm to accelerate k-means
1. The paper is added in this directory (New ideas based on Hamerly's algorithm to accelerate k-means.pdf)
2. My proposed algorithm is faster and has better k-means objective than Hamerley's algorithm (hplus_kmeans.cpp)
3. The dataset used is included in this directory. Using random Gaussian samples.
